Oh, no, that is what they all say
When they see me pouring some more
Oh, oh, think it's empty again
Better fill it up 'fore I go

'Cause I'm, loving it, feeling it
Touch me and be in it
See what I see in it
Untypical
Messing around with it
Mix it up, go with it
Fuck with it, flow with it
Let it all go

Oh, Lord, think you know what I'm like
But you don't, 'fore you loose control

Bittersweet melody
When I dance on your floor
'Cause I know what you don't
It is me you adore

How does it feel to breathe when you're dead?
They never seen you outta your head
Cut to the bone, it's broken, I bet
How sad
Oh, boy, got so hot I forgot
What I should have thought of before
Sure ain't easy for you to let
Go of the rules 'cause they're so much fun

Are you loving it, feeling it
Touch me, are you in it?
Don't see what you seeing
Untypical
Messing around with it
Mix it up, go with it
Fuck with it, flow with it
Please let it go

Oh, no, think I did it again
I said a few things that I shouldn't have done, well

Bittersweet melody
When I dance on your floor
'Cause I know what you don't
It is me you adore

How does it feel to breathe when you're dead?
They never seen you outta your head
Cut to the bone, it's broken, I bet
How sad
How does it feel to breathe when you're dead?
They never seen you outta your head
Cut to the bone, it's broken, I bet

Now come alive with me
And quit the jealousy
I know you bored
I know it's boring me
Now come alive, baby
Get out the grave and live
I know you bored

How does it feel to breathe when you're dead?
They never seen you outta your head
Cut to the bone, it's broken, I bet
How sad

How does it feel to breathe when you're dead?
They never seen you outta your head
Cut to the bone, it's broken, I bet

How does it feel to breathe when you're dead?
They never seen you outta your head
Cut to the bone, it's broken, I bet
How sad
