They said don't fold
Don't forget all the things you've been taught you've been told
Don't blink, don't run
Don't turn left or turn right or look straight at the sun

My mind's going in circles, I'm trying to fight it
Getting these voices inside to stay quiet
Going to the place where all this began
To start again

Oh, you won't see the light until the dawn breaks, no
'Til it's all said and done you won't know what it takes
Gotta make a wrong turn to turn around
Gotta fall first to pick yourself up off the ground
Until you get lost you'll never be found
And you can't start again until you break down

Breakdown
Until you break down
Breakdown

They said be meek
Look beneath the bed before you go to sleep
Keep both eyes shut
You'll surely get burned if you reach out and touch

My mind is a battle, I'm trying to hide it
Getting the voices inside to stay quiet
Going to the place where all this began
To start again

You won't see the light until the dawn breaks, no
'Til it's all said and done you won't know what it takes
Gotta make a wrong turn to turn around
Gotta fall first to pick yourself up off the ground
Until you get lost you'll never be found
And you can't start again until you break down

Breakdown
Until you break down
Breakdown

'Til it's all said and done you won't know what it takes
Gotta make a wrong turn to turn around
Gotta fall first to pick yourself up off the ground
Until you get lost you'll never be found
And you can't start again until you break down
Hold on, hold on
You're not lost, you're not lost
Hold on, hold on
You're not lost, you're not lost
