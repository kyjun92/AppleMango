Wishing that I could run away with you
Imprisoned by fear
Just pull me away, pull me away
Secret fantasies of me and you
Will they ever see the light of day, light of day
I don't know where you are
But I will find you
I will find you
So if you're out there
Just run until the edge
And fall into me
And see where this could end
We'll make our own life
And leave this world behind
Can you hear me?
Do you feel me in the night?
Night, Night, Night
I don't know where you are
But I will find you
I will find you
I don't know where you are
But I will find you
I will find you
Wishing that I could run away with you
Imprisoned by fear
Just pull me away, pull me away
Secret fantasies of me and you
Will they ever see the light of day, light of day
