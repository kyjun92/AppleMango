Close your eyes
Will you dream for me, some paradise
Tell me, who you see?
'Cause I think I do want you next to me
Want you next to me
But does this work?
'Cause no one can get to you
I like the chase
And I know you do too
And I'm just in love with the idea of you
'Cause I'd cross a million seas
Would you do that for me?
I-I oh, I-I oh
Yea I'd fly this whole word twice
If I could be your paradise
Close your eyes
Will you dream for me, some paradise
Tell me, who you see?
'Cause I think I know
What you mean to me
What you mean to me
But does this work?
Only 'cause we never say
What we think
Waiting for the perfect way
Time some speak, got me on delay
'Cause I'd cross a million seas
Would you do that for me?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
If I'll cut to more three times
I'll run all the red light
I'd cross a million seas
Just to have you next to me
Paris and Tokyo
Look at where I have to go
Screw geography
Would you do that for me?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
