We ain't perfect, no
It's a work in progress, good things go slow
And I'm no saint
I fall and you pick me up again
You got your habits
I got 'em too
Just feel like maybe I could lose 'em with you
Sinking in and I guess I kinda like that
For the first time you really got my back
Got your habits
I got 'em too
Just feel like maybe I could lose 'em with you
Lose 'em with you
Lose 'em with you
Just feel like maybe I could lose them with...
I'm no saint
Hey-ey-ey, yeah, yeah
I'm no saint
Hey-ey-ey, yeah, yeah
I'm no saint, saint, saint
Saint, saint, saint, saint
I'm no saint, saint, saint
Saint, saint, saint, saint
I'm no saint, saint, saint
Saint, saint, saint, saint
I'm no saint...
(Lose 'em with you)
(Hey-ey, yeah, yeah)
(Lose 'em with you)
(Hey-ey, yeah, yeah)
