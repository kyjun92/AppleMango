They all thought I wouldn't make it
They all think that you're faking
But seeing ain't believing
I know now
I'd seek all your stupid
Burning is my fuel, yeah
'Cause we're running out of time
So I'm gonna make you mine
The chosen one, I'm not the one that underestimates
I want the throne, I long to crush the structure, rush the barricades
Levitate, got it tatted on me, told them, "Follow me"
They see the vision, I was twenty-twenty, clear as tower lace
As clear as state, no longer move around and fear that this will break
Pray you hear me
Like the winter wind that gets through the windowpane
Feel the bass
Baby, soak it in and let it marinate
It's time to hustle
Got to muscle up and run through barricades, yeah

Feel the bass
Baby, soak it in and let it marinate
It's time to hustle
Got to muscle up and run through barricades, yeah
I got their opinions
And I've got mine
This tequila isn't about me
I wind back the time
Take it on me, take a seat, it's okay
It's hard to get in touch, do you even know me?
Still about the love
Nothing's changed, I don't play that game
'Cause we're running out of time
So I gotta make
So I gotta make
So I gotta make you mine
