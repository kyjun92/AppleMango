When I'm with you
I am able to keep pushing my limits
And all the drive that I have
I am going the distance
With You
I didn't know what I had
Till I knew what was missing
And everything that I dread
Well I built a resistance
With You
Catch me when I fall
And I will keep you off the ground
You were gone I wish you stayed
I could look at you for days
Time was well spent, thats when I knew
That I need to spend my life here with you
Take your time
Not in the fast lane
I understand that you've been broken
Too many times but I'lll be waiting
To mend your wounds
From all you've taken
But if we listen to each other
Admit our mistakes
Then I can show you I am
Because I'm not the same
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
You
Catch me when I fall
And I will keep you off the ground
Thats when I knew
That I need to spend my life here with you
